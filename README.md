# 99 Scala problems


## Origins
In August 2014 I've created a blog post, 
where I've stated that I will challenge myself to solve well known [99 Scala problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) in 333 days.

This project holds a code repository for the solutions I came up with during the challenge.

While solving the problems, I try to my journey on my [blog](http://www.rabbitonweb.com/category/scala/99-problems/)
